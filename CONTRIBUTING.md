# Contributing

This open source library was mainly written for me to improve my coding abilities as well as learn more about chess
engines. As such, there is tons of missing features and improvements to be made and I gladly accept any help on this
repository.

## Setting up your Environment

Follow these instructions to set up your environment.

    1. Create a fork (if you already have a local repository, skip to step 3)

    2. Clone the repository through command line or a GUI (I personally use GitKraken)

    3. Move to your local repository

    4. Configure an upstream remote to keep your fork updated

    ```
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/NiflheimDev/Stockfish-Java.git
    ```

    5. Create a branch based on upstream/development

    ```
    $ git checkout -b patch-1 upstream/development
    Switched to new branch 'upstream/development'
    ```
